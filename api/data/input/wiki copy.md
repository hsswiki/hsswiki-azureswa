### Director Andrew Faris 2025-03-04 for Financial Due Diligence (Doc Gen)

Hi Andrew, this is Shen from the FDD and Microsoft GenAI project. Thank you for your kind support and valuable advices as always. As the FDD Outside-In project is finished last Friday, would you mind reviewing my efforts with a snapshot at your convenience? I really appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation Application Development
  - Designed and developed the backend of a RAG app that can generate 3 kinds of financial due diligence report based on Python, Azure OpenAI, and AI Search. The backend orchestrates upload, vectorization, generation, output formatting, and conversation services to provide a seamless user experience.

Shen went above and beyond consistently on our project. Shen was a leader ---- driving quality across all code development. Shen coached other team members, and picked up the slack whenever required. If there was a “big hard problem that no one could solve”, Shen was tasked with it and he accomplished it with ease. Shen has high attention to detail. In fact, when the application was compared with a ‘industry AI product that has been around for 6 years’, it was determined that our AI capability was better, largely due to Shen's AI mindset and coding capabilities.

As Shen looks to be a manager, he can continue to improve his delegation abilities where he can assign tasks to junior staff and oversee the quality and development of them.

As mentioned in Shen's strengths, Shen is a core team player, a mentor, and a high-quality engineer. Shen will be an amazing manager with the ability to lead large scale AI delivery teams.

### SM John 2025-02-07 for MSFT GenAI

- GenAI application design and development

  - Designed and developed the backend of 2 GenAI applications with Python on Azure: Invoice Checker automates the review process of invoices with configurable rules for each spending category. It leverages OCR and translation to preprocess the inputs and uses LLM to generate reimbursement outcomes.

    Audit Assistant helps auditors to review financial documents by comparing key information such as customer name and invoice amount between user uploaded documents and the database. It uses OCR, translation, and FX API to process financial documents and applies LLM to analyze and generate audit reports.

Shen is one of the most talented, methodical, and thorough people I’ve worked with. His skills and the quality of his work were unmatched. He was one of the two team members we leaned on most when things got tough. Shen captures every detail and thinks through problems in a way I truly admire. We could not have had the success we had without Shen's contributions and leadership on his workstreams. Shen was given the hardest tasks & was up to all of them, operating diligently with extreme precision.
